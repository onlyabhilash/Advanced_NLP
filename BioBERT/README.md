# BioBERT Projects

Here are two recent implementations to understand how BioBERT can be used on biomedical text in two different NLP tasks. 

The first task is NER to tag several entity types, with a focus on genes and proteins, and more details of that project can be found here:

The second taks is classification to spot professions and medical terminology. It needs to be expanded on and is currently being improved.
